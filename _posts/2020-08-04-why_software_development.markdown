I have always been interested in coding ever since I got my first computer that I could remember. I started off playing a lot of videogames and I would always go into the files and add a mod or script. Writing code has always been an interest to me but I saw it as a small hobby, I knew the basics of how to do it but I didn't want to always do it. My first job was in junior year of high school where my friends parents offered me a job to work as their part time web editor. There I was fully immersed into HTML. I had no idea what I was doing at first and then I started to pick up on it quickly by googling certain things. I would run out of things to do, so I would get really bored and that is when I started to lose interest in coding.

Three years later, I graduated from high school, attempted to do networking management at my local community college but I couldn't keep up with the core classes (math, english, etc.), but I excelled at the computer stuff. I was working a "part-time" job but it ended up being a full-time job at a movie theater and I was making good money for my age so I strictly focused on working and getting money to satisfy myself. About a year after I stopped going to college, I decided to go back but go into computer engineering, which was completely different from what I expected and changed back to network management. I was having issues with the core classes again, so my father told me about the coding bootcamps and it really peaked my interest because of how much it focused on the coding aspect. I have always been interested coding and I decided I wanted to learn more. I realized how much I like coding compared to the other stuff I have done. So I applied for Flatiron and now here I am writing a blog about why I decided to learn software development.
