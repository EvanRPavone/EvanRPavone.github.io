I love it. Sinatra is a really fun time for me especially because it can use HTML and CSS, which is my favorite thing to do. My project allows users to write a review on video games they have played and post them to a game reviews page. On this page they are able to see other reviews by other users. The user will also have the ability to edit or delete their reviews. [Click Me](https://youtu.be/j-aPzFtImqg) to see my demo.

The user is able to create and account which adds their info to a database including a secure password using the bcrypt gem. The users have many reviews and the reviews belong to the user. After I got the database setup it was smooth sailing from there. The issue I had an issue with was implementing the information onto the page. I kept getting errors because I didn't define my methods correctly, which was an easy fix, I just tend to overthink.

I know we weren't suppose to focus on the HTML and CSS side of things but I really wanted to and I think it turned out pretty well. Using sections really helps organize the page and is easy to edit the css for each section.
