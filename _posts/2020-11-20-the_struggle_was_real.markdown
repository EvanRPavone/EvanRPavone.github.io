Very stressfull!

I just want to start off by saying, this was a hard module for me. I can't seem to wrap my head around any of this stuff but I managed and made a application. I know what you are thinking, why didn't you reach out to my cohort for help? Well, I do like to figure stuff out on my own, but the main reason would be I have severe social anxiety when it comes to asking for help. I do like JavaScript, I just don't understand it well.

Now... This project.... I had a very difficult time making everything work the way I wanted too. I probably made 5 different repositories for applications that did different things, mainly because I kept breaking my code and got too stressed out, but I kept coming back to this one. I wanted to keep track of all my favorite songs and I managed to do that with this application. The part that got stressful was the ability to add the delete function to the code. I had and still have no idea how to do it, the application can live on without it but it still bothers me that I couldn't figure it out. The way the songs are related to the artist is through the artist name, and I defined that in my controllers, but I found out the best way would to use the artist or song id instead. I failed to do that and I got extremely lost in my code. I ended up breaking it a lot and I couldn't figure it out, so I left the delete function out of it, but I am still trying. I did add a delete button though, which is exciting for me, it just doesn't do anything. Once I got everything looking nice and pretty I was content with what I made, satisfied? No, but comfortable? Yes. 

I do want to add a few more things to this app. First would be making this delete button actually work, the second would be having the ability to filter songs by an artist. People that are reading this right now are probably face palming right now and know exactly what to do, I will figure it out guys, eventually.

I am hanging in there. I am taking notes on my own code figuring out the best way to describe it to people and going back over my lessons to make sure I have a full understanding. It's taking up most of my time but I hope it will be worth it in the end.
